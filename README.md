- 👋 Hi, I’m Fredrik aka @FEHorn here
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot, hard to define - let me get back to you when I know for sure 
- 🌱 I have just been accepted to a further education called "System Developer - Python and IT Security" - It will be so much fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something later on
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure... try harder maybe?
